# 2048 Game

Welcome to the 2048 Game implemented in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project is a simple version of the popular 2048 puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Features

- Purely Python-based project
- GUI implemented using Tkinter
- Smooth tile movements
- Score tracking
- Restart functionality

## The folder has 3 files :
- **logic.py** which contains the actual logic of the game.
- **design.py** which contains the design of the Game.
- **2048.py** which binds the **logic.py** and **design.py** into a single file using the TKinter library for the designing.
